Bugs

can't delete an event if there are participants already signed-up for it. Now need to find all the participants, send them an email, and then delete. Or make the event inactive and hide it.

Cut due to debug from base.html:

        {% block navbar %}
        <nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-dark">
          <span class="navbar-text">
                Are we going?
                {% if user.screen_name %}
                {{user.screen_name}}, let's make it happen
                <button class="btn btn-sm align-right btn-outline-secondary" type="button"><a href="{{ url_for('logout') }}">Logout</a></button>
                {% elif path != "/" and path != "/login/" %}
                Log in to setup activities or commit to participation

                {% endif %}
          </span>
        </nav>
        {% endblock %}




                {% if user.screen_name %}

                {% elif %}

                {% endif %}
